# Midnight GSD Wallet

Chrome extension wallet for dApp developers building on the [Midnight](https://midnight.network) blockchain. Designed for testing and debugging on Undeployed (local), DevNet, QANet, Preview, PreProd, and Mainnet environments.

**This is not a production wallet.** Seeds are stored unencrypted. Use it to develop and test your dApps, not to hold real funds.

## Who is this for?

- **dApp developers** testing contract deployments, token transfers, and DApp connector integration
- **QA engineers** verifying wallet behavior across Midnight environments
- **SDK integrators** building their own Midnight wallet (see [Integration Guide](docs/WALLET-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md))

## Features

- **Multi-environment** — Undeployed (localhost), DevNet, QANet, Preview, PreProd, Mainnet
- **Wallet manager menu** — unified dropdown showing all wallets grouped by network, with create/switch/delete/copy-seed actions
- **Quick-start on localnet** — one-click import of 4 prefunded genesis wallets (W0-W3)
- **Wallet management** — generate 24-word mnemonic or import seed phrase / hex seed
- **Multi-wallet** — multiple wallets per environment, each with isolated sync state
- **Shielded & unshielded transfers** — send tokens with ZK proving via server prover
- **Dust operations** — register/deregister UTXOs for dust generation
- **DApp connector** — `window.midnight` injection implementing the Midnight DApp connector API
- **Custom endpoints** — override Node, Indexer, and Prover URLs per environment

### Sync & diagnostics

- **Non-blocking sync** — UI renders immediately while the wallet syncs in the background; no blank screens or loading spinners
- **Per-wallet sync progress** — Shielded/Unshielded/Dust progress shown in the status bar and debug tabs
- **Sync phase in header** — current phase (Connecting/Syncing X%/Stalled/Synced) displayed next to the network selector
- **Stall detection** — automatic detection when sync stops advancing for 30s (e.g., after WebSocket disconnect); shown as "Stalled" with warning diagnostic
- **SDK console interception** — captures `@polkadot/api` RPC-CORE errors, WebSocket disconnects, and reconnection events that normally only appear in the browser console
- **Persistent diagnostics** — 2000-event ring buffer persisted to `chrome.storage.session`; survives service worker restarts (Chrome kills idle SWs after ~30s)
- **Filterable event stream** — filter by level (DBG/INF/WRN/ERR) and category (SW/Wallet/State/Sync/SDK/DApp/API/Pop/Tx/Idx/Sto/Err)
- **Log export** — download all diagnostic events as NDJSON with ISO timestamps for sharing in bug reports
- **Status bar** — persistent bottom bar showing connection status, overall sync progress, and per-wallet sync detail
- **Debug tabs** — real-time sync progress, UTXO inspection, token balances per subsystem (Dust/Shielded/Unshielded), transaction history
- **Built-in explorer** — query the v4 indexer for transaction, block, and contract details

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Load in Chrome: `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked → select `dist/`

**Recommended:** Click the expand icon in the header to open in a full browser tab. The popup works but the full-tab view gives you much more space for the debug panel, explorer, and diagnostics.

### Localnet setup

1. Start local infrastructure (node + indexer + proof server)
2. Select "Undeployed" environment in the wallet
3. Click W0 to import the genesis wallet with all minted NIGHT
4. Deploy and test your contracts

### Testnet setup

1. Start a proof server: `docker run -d -p 6300:6300 ghcr.io/midnight-ntwrk/proof-server:8.0.2 midnight-proof-server -v`
2. Select your target network (DevNet, QANet, Preview, PreProd)
3. Import your funded wallet seed
4. Your dApp can discover the wallet via `window.midnight`

## How sync works

The wallet syncs three subsystems independently:

| Subsystem | What it syncs | Why |
|-----------|--------------|-----|
| **Shielded** | All ZSwap events on chain | Privacy — wallet filters locally so the indexer never sees your viewing keys |
| **Unshielded** | Only your transactions | Public — indexer can filter by address without privacy risk |
| **Dust** | All dust events on chain | Same privacy model as shielded — local filtering |

**First sync is slow on mainnet** (~87k shielded + ~87k dust events). The unshielded subsystem syncs instantly because it only streams your transactions.

**Persistent SDK storage** ensures sync survives Chrome's service worker lifecycle. The wallet serializes SDK state to IndexedDB every 10 seconds during sync. When Chrome kills the service worker (after ~30s idle), the next restart restores from the last checkpoint and continues syncing — no progress is lost. Full mainnet sync completes across multiple SW restarts without the user needing to keep the popup open.

The two-phase initialization ensures the UI is never blocked:
1. **Phase 1 (fast):** Load checkpoint from IndexedDB (if available), create facade with restored or fresh state, subscribe to state, emit initial state to UI
2. **Phase 2 (background):** `facade.start()` connects to indexer/node, sync resumes from checkpoint offset; state updates flow to UI progressively

## DApp connector

The wallet injects `window.midnight[uuid]` on all pages and dispatches `midnight#ready` for discovery.

**17 API methods:** `getShieldedBalances`, `getUnshieldedBalances`, `getDustBalance`, `getShieldedAddresses`, `getUnshieldedAddress`, `getDustAddress`, `getConfiguration`, `getConnectionStatus`, `makeTransfer`, `balanceUnsealedTransaction`, `balanceSealedTransaction`, `submitTransaction`, `signData`, `getTxHistory`, `hintUsage`, `getProvingProvider`, `makeIntent`.

`getTxHistory` returns `[]` (stub). `getProvingProvider` and `makeIntent` return errors — use `getConfiguration()` for prover URL.

## Explorer

Type a transaction hash, block height, or contract address in the search field:

| Input | Lookup |
|-------|--------|
| Number (e.g. `121972`) | Block by height |
| 64-char hex | Transaction by hash, falls back to contract |

## Network configuration

| Environment | Node RPC | Indexer |
|---|---|---|
| Undeployed | `localhost:9944` | `localhost:8088/api/v4/graphql` |
| DevNet | `rpc.devnet.midnight.network` | `indexer.devnet.midnight.network/api/v4/graphql` |
| QANet | `rpc.qanet.midnight.network` | `indexer.qanet.midnight.network/api/v4/graphql` |
| Preview | `rpc.preview.midnight.network` | `indexer.preview.midnight.network/api/v4/graphql` |
| PreProd | `rpc.preprod.midnight.network` | `indexer.preprod.midnight.network/api/v4/graphql` |
| Mainnet | `rpc.mainnet.midnight.network` | `indexer.mainnet.midnight.network/api/v4/graphql` |

Proof server: `localhost:6300` for all environments.

## Security

Intentional trade-offs for developer convenience:

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Seed storage | Plaintext in IndexedDB — do not use for real funds |
| Password protection | Disabled |
| DApp connections | Auto-approved, no user confirmation |
| CSP | `wasm-unsafe-eval` required for Midnight SDK WASM |

## Known issues

- **Mainnet RPC disconnects** — The mainnet RPC node (`wss://rpc.mainnet.midnight.network`) periodically drops WebSocket connections with `1000: Normal Closure`. The `@polkadot/api` SDK reconnects automatically but sync can stall temporarily. The wallet detects stalls after 30s and shows "Stalled". No user action needed — persistent storage preserves progress across SW restarts, and the offscreen keepalive document extends SW lifetime during active sync.
- **First mainnet sync takes minutes** — ~87k shielded + ~87k dust events must be downloaded and processed client-side. This is by design for privacy (see "How sync works" above). Persistent SDK storage ensures sync completes across service worker restarts — no need to keep the popup open.
